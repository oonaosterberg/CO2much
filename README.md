#CO2much 

This is a project i did with my partner in university on 
'Media Services and User Experience' course. The project is done using 
Angular 5 and Google Maps and Brighter Planet APIs. 

CO2much is an app where you can keep track of your sustainability by marking the 
ecological choices in your everyday life and seeing the progress. You can also compare
the carbon emission of your commute depending on which transportation method you choose.
